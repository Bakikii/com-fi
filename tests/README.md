## Quality regression test
Compares images in 2 directories to ensure they are the same

1) Run an inference test to save a directory of "ground truth" images

    pytest tests/inference --output_dir tests/inference/baseline
```
2) Make code edits

3) Run inference and quality comparison tests
```
pytest
```
