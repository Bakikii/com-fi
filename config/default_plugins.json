All old workflow will still be work with this repo but the version option won't do anything. Almost all v1 preprocessors are replaced by v1.1 except those doesn't appear in v1.1. [w/NOTE: Please refrain from using the controlnet preprocessor alongside this installation, as it may lead to conflicts and prevent proper recognition.]"
